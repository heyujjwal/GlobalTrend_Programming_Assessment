# Global Trend Programming Profile Assessment Questions
## Assessment Overview
### This assessment consists of 10 programming questions designed to evaluate your problem-solving and coding skills in C++. 


### Questions
#### 1. Write a function to reverse a singly linked list.The function should take the head of the list and return the new head of the reversed list.
#### 2. Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.The function should return an integer representing the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
#### 3. Given a non-empty binary tree, find the maximum path sum. A path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The path must contain at least one node and does not need to go through the root.The function should return an integer representing the maximum path sum.
#### 4. Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment. Implement the serialize and deserialize methods.
#### 5. Write a function to rotate an array to the right by k steps.The function should modify the array in place to achieve the rotation.
#### 6. Write a function to find the factorial of a given number.The function should return the factorial of the number.
#### 7. Write a function to compute the sum of the digits of a given number.The function should return the sum of the digits of the number.
#### 8. Write a function to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. The function should return the GCD of a and b.
#### 9. Write a function to find the maximum difference between any two elements in an array.The function should return the maximum difference between any two elements in the array.
#### 10. Write a function to check if a given string contains only alphabetic characters.The function should return true if the string contains only alphabetic characters, and false otherwise.
